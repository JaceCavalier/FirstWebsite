//Class Problem
//Write a 'while' Loop below using the coinflip function to print 10 times
//while (total < 20) {
  //total+=1;
  //coinFlip();
  //console.log(heads + " out of " + total + ": " + ratio);
  

//};
  
//Using For Loops: Homework

// print all even numbers between 1 and 20 (hint: don't forget to increment)
//while (total < 20){
  //total++;
  //coinFlip();
  //console.log(heads + " out of " + total + ": " + ratio);
//};

//Starting at 7, print out all multiples of 7 below 100


//Starting at 10, print out all numbers down to 0
